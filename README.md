# fastapi-rag-system
This repository contains a complete implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FastAPI and OpenAI’s API. The project provides a practical example of how to build and integrate a sophisticated AI-driven system that combines retrieval and generation techniques.

# Key Technologies:

•	**FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

•	**OpenAI**: A powerful AI model API for natural language processing, enabling advanced text generation and comprehension capabilities.

•	**PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database system used for storing and managing application data.

# Project Tasks

1. Introduction

- Task 0: Getting Started

	•	Set up your development environment.
	•	Install necessary dependencies and libraries.

2. Building the API with FastAPI

- Task 1: Create Basic API Endpoints

	•	Define and implement basic API endpoints using FastAPI.
	•	Ensure that your endpoints follow best practices for API design.

- Task 2: Integrate OpenAI’s API

	•	Set up the integration with OpenAI’s API.
	•	Implement functionality to interact with OpenAI’s models.

- Task 3: Write the Testing Script

	•	Develop a script to test your API endpoints.
	•	Ensure your API behaves as expected under various conditions.

3. Managing and Parsing Documents

- Task 4: Improve the Document Upload

	•	Enhance the document upload functionality to support multiple file types.

- Task 5: Parse Text Documents

	•	Implement functionality to parse and process text documents.

- Task 6: Parse PDF Documents with OCR

	•	Integrate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to parse text from PDF documents.

4. Database Integration and Management

- Task 7: Create and Test the Database

	•	Design and implement the database schema.
	•	Test the database setup to ensure data integrity and performance.

- Task 8: Implement Background Tasks

	•	Set up background tasks for processing and handling long-running operations.

- Task 9: Integrate the Database with the FastAPI Application

	•	Connect your FastAPI application with the database.
	•	Ensure seamless data retrieval and manipulation within the application.

- Task 10: Test the FastAPI Application

	•	Perform comprehensive testing of the FastAPI application.
	•	Verify that all components work together as intended and handle edge cases gracefully.

# Getting Started
1.	Clone the Repository
